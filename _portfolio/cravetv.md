At Bell Media, I worked on CraveTV 2, which required extensive work across the organization, prior CraveTV via a hybrid solution.

The application had 400K Daily Active Users and over 3 Million Downloads

I made major contributions I worked on:

* Accessibility Feature
* The Downloads Feature
* The Analytics Integration
* The iPad Sections 
* The tvOS Sections
