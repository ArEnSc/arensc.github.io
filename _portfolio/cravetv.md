At Bell Media, I worked on the popular CraveTV 2 mobile application. This app required extensive cross communication and work across the organization, prior CraveTV via a hybrid solution.

The application had 400K Daily Active Users and over 3 Million Downloads

Major features I contributed to include:

1. Accessibility Feature
	+ I introduced accessibility labels through out the whole app for buttons and speced out screens to allow a user with visual limitations to navigate the app more fluidly throughout the app. 

2. The Downloads Feature
	+ I gathered and implemented requirements necessary to introduce the ability to watch video's offline. This required me initially when the application was introduced, the application had no ability to watch video's offline. I gathered requirements and cross cordinated with different teams to integrate and build the UI/UX and business logic behind the feature to enable this feature to allow videos to be downloaded and watched while the device was not connected to the internet.

3. The Analytics Integration
	+ Analytics helped the product team glean data to determine which features were successful and unsuccessful after every launch. My integration allowed the product team to measure the effectiveness of a UI/UX design and gave product insight into various features such as downloads and home screen. 

4. The iPad, tvOS Sections 
	+ The application required many of the screens to be functionally availible for the iPad and tvOS, this required reworking of the UI, which was work done by the team and my self.
