## What I Do

As a Full-Stack Software Consultant, I help businesses:

- **Design & Architecture**: Build scalable, maintainable system architectures from MVP to enterprise scale
- **iOS Development**: Native iOS applications using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit
- **Web Development**: Modern web applications with React, Node.js, and cloud-native technologies
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implement ML/AI solutions for real-world business problems
- **Technical Leadership**: Guide teams through complex technical decisions and best practices

## Technical Expertise

**Frontend**: React, SwiftUI, UIKit, TypeScript, Next.js, Vue.js  
**Backend**: Node.js, Python, Swift, RESTful APIs, GraphQL  
**Mobile**: iOS (Swift), React Native, Core Data, ARKit  
**Data & ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn  
**Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Firebase  

### Generative AI & Advanced ML Specialization

**Leadership Experience**: Former CTO at FakeYou.com and Storyteller.ai (raised $3M seed funding)  
**Research Contributions**: Core contributor to RWKV paper on efficient linear models with infinite context  
**Large Language Models**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini, Llama 3.1, Mistral  
**Small Language Models**: Phi-3, Gemma, TinyLlama, StableLM - expert in edge deployment  
**AI Agents**: Multi-agent systems, autonomous agents, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT  
**Vector Databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Chroma for RAG systems  
**Model Optimization**: Quantization, distillation, LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning

## Research Publications

### RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era
**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13048](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13048)

I contributed to this groundbreaking research on RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value), a novel architecture that combines the efficiency of RNNs with the performance of Transformers. Key innovations include:

- **Linear Attention Mechanism**: O(n) complexity vs O(nÂ²) for traditional transformers
- **Infinite Context Length**: Theoretically unlimited context window
- **State-Space Formulation**: Efficient sequential processing with parallelizable training
- **Production Efficiency**: 10-100x lower memory usage for long sequences
- **Open Source Impact**: Democratizing access to efficient large language models

This work enables practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments and opens new possibilities for processing extremely long documents, continuous learning, and real-time applications.

## My Unique Journey

Beyond traditional software development, I bring a unique perspective shaped by entrepreneurial ventures:

### Databites Academy
Founded and led Databites, a data science education startup where I:
- Developed comprehensive curriculum for aspiring data scientists
- Taught complex technical concepts to diverse audiences
- Built the technical infrastructure for online learning
- Managed both technical and business operations

These experiences give me a unique ability to understand not just the technical requirements, but the business context and constraints that drive successful software projects.

## Why Work With Me

- **Full-Stack Perspective**: I understand the entire technology stack, ensuring seamless integration
- **Business Acumen**: Entrepreneurial experience means I think beyond code to business impact
- **Proven Track Record**: Successfully delivered projects ranging from startups to enterprise clients
- **Clear Communication**: I translate complex technical concepts into actionable business insights
- **Agile & Adaptive**: Experienced with various methodologies and adaptable to your team's workflow

## My Writing & Thoughts

Through this blog, I share insights on:
- Software architecture patterns and best practices
- iOS development techniques and SwiftUI innovations
- Machine learning applications in production
- Lessons learned from entrepreneurship and consulting
- Technical deep-dives and tutorials

I believe in the power of long-form technical discussion in our fast-paced world. My posts aim to provide the depth and nuance that complex topics deserve.
