My name is Michael, and this is my story.

Who am I? I am a Software Consultant and a Software/iOS Developer. 

I have been told that I have fascinating thoughts and should write a blog, or perhaps become a Youtube Coder. And that is why I am here today.

If I am completely honest, this blog should have been written sooner. However, I spent most of my career just working 50-60 hour weeks and never had the chance to reflect or build my portfolio. It was finally when I decided to move my career in another direction that I thought I should start building my portfolio and recording my thoughts about the software industry.

I anticipate that the ideas I will discuss in this blog will be too intractable to have in a short, casual chat. These topics and notions typically require a long form conversation. And lets face it, our fast paced world today doesn't seem to promote an indepth discussion and review. I do also plan on incoporating tutorials and notes into this blog. Topics that I plan on covering range from iOS Development to Machine Learning, and even delving into Deep Learning.

I would also like to share stories of my success, and even touch on my failures, and what I have been able to take away from both. Two big turning points in my career, and admittedly my life, include the purchase of a pizzeria, [Papa Ceo](https://www.papaceo.ca/), and Databites, a data science school that I founded which has since been dissolved (which is where the branding and avatar logo* for this site has been inherited from). 

As stated above, I am a Software Consultant and offer professional services for both small and large businesses. If you are interested in working together, my current rate is $800 USD a day.
